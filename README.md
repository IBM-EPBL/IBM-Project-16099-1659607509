-   Crude oil price fluctuations have a far reaching impact on global economies and thus price forecasting can assist in minimising the risks associated with volatility in oil prices.

-   The Brent crude oil spot price in our forecast averages $98 per barrel (b) in the fourth quarter of 2022 (4Q22) and $97/b in 2023.

-   Price forecasts are very important to various stakeholders: governments, public and private enterprises, policymakers, and investors.

-   Raw futures prices are found to be unbiased predictors of future oil prices; that is, for the past two decades, the raw oil futures prices are as likely to overpredict as to underpredict future oil prices

-   We further propose a new hybrid crude oil price forecasting model based on the deep learning model.

-   Using the proposed model, major crude oil price movement is analyzed and modeled.

-   The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using the price data in the WTI crude oil markets.

-   The empirical results show that the proposed model achieves the improved forecasting accuracy.
